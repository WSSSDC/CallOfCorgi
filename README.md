Notes*:

 - Windows & Web have been tested and are working fine.
 - Due to macOS's unnessesary security you probably can't simply run the macOS version.
 - The macOS version does work with both Intel chips and Apple Silicon.
 - We were too tired to test the linux version. You can come back later.

## Inspiration
We decided to built this video game because we were curious about how game design and development works and we chose the corgi theme from.... well CorgiHacks!

## What it does
Call Of Corgi, is a simple platformer game. Your goal is to reach the end of the game and destroy all the aliens in your way in order to save humanity from certain death.

## How we built it
Call of Corgi was built by the Unity Game Engine. We used variety of publicly available and some custom built/modified assets in order to make the game in 2D.

## Challenges we ran into
Due to the lack in game design and development experience across the team we faced the following challenges:

 - Lack of assets to build the game environment as planned
 - Lack of design skills to create custom assets
 - One of our team members spent shit lots of time rendering cut scenes which never actually made it into the game.
 - Lack of cooperative teammates

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 - "Well, the game works."
 - We learned much new skills in game design and development
 - We had fun while designing the game
## What we learned
 - Physics Simulation In Blender
 - Physics Simulation In Unity
 - C that is sharp
 - Basic AI for enemies
 - 2D game design in Unity

## What's next for Call of Corgi

 - Rebuild of the game in 3D
 - Adding Extra Levels
 - Adding more of the planned story to the game
 - Introducing new mechanics and fun gameplay
 - Graphics Overhaul
